        "1 introduction. this final surrender report details exploration activities undertaken by sandfire resources limited (sandfire) on the murchison combined reporting group (c 35/2015) between the first grant date of 19 june 2014 and the final surrender date of all tenements, 22 november 2023 (the reporting period). the exploration licences overlie favourable stratigraphy within the mineral-rich bryah basin, and are considered to be prospective for volcanogenic massive-sulfide (vms)-style cu-au-ag mineralisation. 2 location and access. the murchison project (the project) is located approximately 70 to 90 km north to nne of meekatharra, 20 to 40 km south to southwest of the historical peak hill copper and gold mining centre, and 70 to 90 km southwest of sandfire\u2019s degrussa cu-au mine. access to the project is via the great northern highway, ashburton downs- meekatharra road or the meekatharra-mount clare road, then by pastoral tracks. these tracks may be closed to vehicles during wet periods. 3 tenement details. 3.1 tenements. exploration licences 51/1647, 51/1672, 51/1673, 51/1702, 51/1759, 51/1805, 51/1967, 51/1968, 52/2880, 52/2881 and 52/3330 made up the murchison combined reporting group, c 35/2015. tenement details are listed in table 3.1. on 4 april 2022 a partial relinquishment of 14 graticule blocks on e 52/3330 was registered with dmirs. a total of 21 blocks remained. an outright surrender of exploration licences 51/1647, 51/1672, 51/1673, 51/1702, 51/1759, 51/1805, 51/1967, 51/1968, 52/2880, 52/2881 and 52/3330 was registered with dmirs on 22 november 2023. 3.2 landholders. the murchison project covers vacant crown land and partly encroaches on mt padbury pastoral lease (3114/1134), southwest of peak hill. the lessees of mt padbury pastoral lease, brian garrity, james harvey nichols and william robert nichols, were advised of the relevant grants. 3.3 native title. the majority of the tenements that make up the murchison project are located within the wajarri yamatji native title claim (wc04/010), with the exception of e 52/3330 which is located within the nharnuwangga wajarri ngarlawangga native title determination (wcd00/001). an alternative standard heritage agreement was negotiated with the wajarri yamatji native title claim during the application process,",

(1998) and pirajno et al. (2004) led to the subdivision of the lower proterozoic sequence into four distinct basins: yerrida, bryah, padbury and earaheedy. the pull-apart (proto-oceanic) basin into which these formations were deposited was controlled by major basement strike-slip faults that created a complex array of horsts and grabens. this fault array controlled sedimentation, volcanism, and later, structural complexity. the time frame from initiation of the basin to its closure was in the order of 150 million years (jeffrey, 2011). the bryah basin sequence contains deformed and metamorphosed mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks, and chemical and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks within four formations, two of which are present over the tenement area: the karalundi and narracoota formations (pirajno and occhipinti, 1998). in mapping of the peak hill 1:250,000 sheet the geological survey of western australia (gswa) described the karalundi formation as a mixed clastic-carbonate, chert-tuff sequence, lying conformably between the doolgunna arkose and the narracoota volcanics in the southern part of the bryah basin, that represents a transition from a shallow-water marine environment to a rift environment, and the commencement of basalt volcanism. the narracoota formation conformably overlies the karalundi formation in the type area, which is specified",
